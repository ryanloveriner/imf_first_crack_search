# IMF RM-60 Inlet Bubble Analysis

#### This study is the the first part of Iconik Coffee Roaster's ongoing First Crack Identification project, which aims to use sensor data produced by the IMF model RM-60 air roaster to identify the time and/or bean mass temperature of a given roast's first crack. Boxplots and ANOVA tests are used to demonstrate statistical associations between several inlet metrics and bean-roast groups, suggesting that the inlet temperature bubble phenomemon may be used to identify first crack. Further research involving A/B testing is recommended.
