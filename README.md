## This report compares the projected results of the [IMF RM-60 Inlet Bubble Analysis](https://github.com/ryanloveriner/imf_first_crack_search/tree/inlet_bubble_analysis) study with Iconik's pre-study first crack identification process.

[This dashboard](https://github.com/ryanloveriner/imf_first_crack_search/blob/reference_first_crack_comparison/First%20Crack%20Comparison.png) compares first crack time and temperature based on the study with Iconik's pre-existing reference curves, highlighting the extant differences between aurally-based and sensory-based first crack identification.
